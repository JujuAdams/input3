## Gamepad Troubleshooting
_Per-platform device drivers, software, and connectivity troubleshooting tips_

If you encounter trouble using your gamepad with Input, ensure the gamepad device's firmware is up to date, and that it is working correctly on your Operating System. Input includes comprehensive built-in support for a wide variety of controllers, and so disabling intermediary software and unofficial controller applications that may interfere with normal operation is recommended, including Xpadder, JoyToKey, AntiMicro, x360ce, ScpToolkit, MotioninJoy, and InputMapper.

## Device Mapping

If your gamepad is an uncommon model or variant and seems to be presenting an incorrect button layout, it may be absent from the [mapping database](Controller-Mapping). Consider providing data for your device to the [SDL Community Gamepad DB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB) if you are able, or reaching Input's maintainers [on Discord](https://discord.gg/8krYCqr) to discuss further.
